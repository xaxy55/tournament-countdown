# Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Supported versions

This project is maintained on a best-effort basis. Only the latest code on `main` is supported for security fixes. Older tags/releases are not maintained.

## Report a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories:

- https://github.com/xaxy55/tournament-countdown/security/advisories/new

Do not open public GitHub issues for security reports.

When reporting, include as much detail as possible:
- Affected component, version/commit, and environment
- Impact and severity (what could an attacker achieve?)
- Step-by-step reproduction or proof-of-concept
- Any mitigations or workarounds you’ve identified

If you cannot use the advisory form, you may open a minimal public issue requesting a private contact channel (avoid including sensitive details).

## Coordinated disclosure

- We’ll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours (business days).
- We aim to provide an initial assessment within 7 days.
- We target a fix or mitigation within 30 days for high/critical issues and 90 days for others, depending on complexity and impact.
- We’ll coordinate a disclosure timeline with you. Credit will be given upon request after a fix is available.

## Scope

In scope: code in this repository and its default configuration. Out of scope: third‑party dependencies, user deployments/infrastructure, and denial‑of‑service tests.

## Safe‑harbor

We welcome good‑faith research that respects:
- No data exfiltration or privacy violations
- No service degradation or DoS
- Test only against your own instances/environments
- Comply with applicable laws

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
